Breakingviews - Buyout firms make first move in EU telco shake-out
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Private equity has made the first call on another round of consolidation in Europe’s telecoms sector. KKR, Cinven and Providence Equity Partners on Monday unveiled a 3 billion euro ($3.3 billion) offer for Spain’s MasMovil. The bid is a welcome intervention for rivals like Telefonica, who will hope the buyout barons have less enthusiasm for the low-cost operator’s cut-throat pricing. For mergers and acquisitions fans, the timing is also propitious.
