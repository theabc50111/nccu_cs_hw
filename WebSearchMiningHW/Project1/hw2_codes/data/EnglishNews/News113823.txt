Breakingviews - Virus hands Elon Musk electrifying cost challenge
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk has a chance to prove to skeptics that he has finally wrapped his head around the basics of running a carmaker. Tesla’s boss seems to have ironed out most of the production problems that have plagued the electric-car maker for much of the past three years, if first-quarter sales numbers unveiled on Thursday are anything to go by. He has also amassed a decent stash of cash, which should be enough for Tesla to go almost a year without revenue before running out of juice. That’s better than either Ford or General Motors can manage. But Musk can only pull that off if he has finally mastered how to keep costs under control.
