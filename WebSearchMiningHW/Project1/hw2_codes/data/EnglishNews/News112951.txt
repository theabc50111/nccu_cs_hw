Breakingviews - Rio Tinto rebellion sets new ESG bar
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rio Tinto’s recklessness has set a welcome new bar for environmental, social and corporate governance. Boss Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies, including the head of its iron ore unit which accounted for 96% of half-year earnings, will step down after outcry over the $105 billion miner’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site in Western Australia. Local activists and shareholders, including the country’s powerful superannuation funds, have led a charge that will inspire other socially-conscious investors.
