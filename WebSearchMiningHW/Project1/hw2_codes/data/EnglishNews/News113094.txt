Breakingviews - Cable Cowboy makes pricey Swiss return call
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Cable Cowboy John Malone has pulled an aggressive pirouette on a tricky Alpine pass. Liberty Global, the telecoms group founded by the U.S. billionaire, is paying $7.4 billion for Sunrise Communications less than a year after failing to persuade it to buy its own Swiss unit. Itâ€™s a riskier and more expensive deal than the original plan, but one Malone can probably live with.
