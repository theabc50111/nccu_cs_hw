Breakingviews - Amazon, NYC shoot selves and each other in foot
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon.com and New York City have shot themselves and each other in the foot. The $800 billion e-commerce giant on Thursday decided to ditch its plans to open a second headquarters, known as HQ2, in the Big Apple after local opposition to the $3 billion in state and city incentives it would receive. It makes Amazon look short-term greedy and not interested in community concerns. Politicians, meanwhile, have cost New York both tax revenue and up to 40,000 jobs.
