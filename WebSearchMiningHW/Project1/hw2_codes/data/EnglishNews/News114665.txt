BREAKINGVIEWS - Iron ore feels the pinch of Beijing's restraint
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Iron ore is feeling the pain of Beijing’s stimulus restraint. Prices for the steelmaking ingredient have cooled after a spike this year. That’s partly thanks to easing supply pressures. China, though, has yet to help demand by splurging on bridges and buildings to counter flagging growth. Government efforts to revive a cooling economy may be far less steel-intensive this time around.
