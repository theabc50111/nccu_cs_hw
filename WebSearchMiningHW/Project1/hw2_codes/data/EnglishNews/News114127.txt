Breakingviews - Will IBM be the next Microsoft or Nokia?
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Arvind Krishna, IBM’s incoming chief executive, has a tough task ahead of him. He will replace current boss Virginia Rometty in April, the company announced on Thursday. Shareholders won’t miss her: At $121 billion, Big Blue’s market value has almost halved since she took the reins at the start of 2012. It now has a reputation as a former hardware provider that lost its way when the world moved on. Microsoft’s resurgence under boss Satya Nadella offers the best path ahead.
