Breakingviews - Uber’s valuation requires both hands on the wheel
WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Uber Technologies’ valuation will force it to keep two hands on the wheel. While the company said on Wednesday its food delivery unit helped minimize a fourth-quarter revenue drop to $3.2 billion, a 16% decline compared to the same quarter last year, the business is still losing money. Meanwhile vaccines should help the San Francisco-based company’s rideshares recover, and its experience in that sector might guide food delivery to profits. Yet the market is giving the company full credit for being in both businesses already, with a richer price than peers that operate solely in either.
