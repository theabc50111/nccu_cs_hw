Breakingviews - Stars align for China tech’s stay-at-home project
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bad news in the United States is good news for a Chinese stay-at-home project. Controversial facial recognition startup Megvii Technology is considering going public on Shanghai’s recently opened STAR Market, the South China Morning Post reported last week. On Monday, state media announced plans for a U.S.-style, registration-based system that will better position ChiNext, Shenzhen’s $187 billion growth board, for new listings. It’s good timing given the suspicion U.S.-listed Chinese firms are falling under. Backers face longer lockups and capital controls, but they should get better valuations.
