Breakingviews - ‘South Park’ makes an anti-diplomat out of Viacom
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Brands often become de facto ambassadors for their home country. Sometimes they become the opposite. Animated series “South Park” seems to have earned itself a ban in China after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone poked fun at their industry’s willingness to self-censor, and then followed up with a sarcastic apology.
