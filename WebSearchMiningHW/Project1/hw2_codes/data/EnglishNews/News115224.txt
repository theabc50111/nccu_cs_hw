Breakingviews - Driving hard bargain could backfire on Hyundai
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Driving a hard bargain could backfire on Hyundai. The South Korean conglomerate’s auto-parts business has offered less than half the $2.2 billion in dividends wanted by pushy U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management. Meanwhile, Hyundai’s carmaker rejected another of the activist’s proposals. These stingier options may ultimately cost it investor support when it comes to a broader restructuring.
