Breakingviews - Belated 737 action marks U.S. soft power erosion
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Boeing’s belatedly grounded jets are an apt symbol of the erosion of U.S. soft power. After saying there was no problem in the wake of two crashes, the most recent on Sunday, the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday grounded Boeing’s 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 aircraft. The FAA usually shows the way, but many other governments had already banned the planes.
