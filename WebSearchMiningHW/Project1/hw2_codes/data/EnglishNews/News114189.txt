Breakingviews - Benettons play risky game of chicken in road row
MILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Benettons are playing a risky game of chicken with Rome. Atlantia, 30%-owned by the sweater-to-infrastructure dynasty, is haggling with the government over compensation for the collapse of a bridge in 2018. The dispute could lead to the loss of Atlantia’s lucrative concession to run Italy’s motorways. A deal, however, looks just about manageable for the 18 billion euro group.
