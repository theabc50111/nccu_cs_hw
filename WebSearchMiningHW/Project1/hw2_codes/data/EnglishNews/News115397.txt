Breakingviews - World Bank could be a new stick to beat China
WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The World Bank could be a new stick for Donald Trump to beat China with. Jim Yong Kim has quit as head of the global lender, and the White House has a big say on his replacement. American officials had already pressured the bank to lend less to China and warned about Beijingâ€™s influence. This gives them a chance to instal a hawkish new boss, and open up a new front in the trade war.
