Breakingviews - Lowly Europe bank values will outlast dividend ban
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The decision to ban Europeâ€™s banks from paying dividends this year is a strong candidate for the most maligned regulatory edict of recent years. Supervisors stopped payouts in an attempt to preserve capital amid rising loan losses and demand for credit. In the eyes of critics, they ruined the case for investing in an already-battered sector. That argument lacks evidence, however. Share prices may remain low even if restrictions are lifted.
