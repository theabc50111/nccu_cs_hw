Breakingviews - Mike Bloomberg can learn from Thomson Reuters
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mike Bloomberg said on Tuesday that he has “a lot of experience” that would be useful if he were president of the United States. Appearing in Iowa, the U.S. state that kicks off the quadrennial primary season, he added that he’d try to sell his financial-data empire if he wins the 2020 presidential race. Lucky for him, money is plentiful for a buyout that could be valued at $40 billion. And there’s a recent deal that could provide a blueprint: the sale of Refinitiv to Blackstone by Breakingviews parent Thomson Reuters.
