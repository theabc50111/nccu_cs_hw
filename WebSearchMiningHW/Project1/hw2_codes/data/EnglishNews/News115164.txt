Breakingviews - Pinduoduo offers New York a Shanghai bargain
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Pinduoduo is giving New York investors a taste of Shanghai. The $29 billion e-commerce outfit, a mainland variation on coupon company Groupon, has all the ingredients of Chinese tech: promise, growth - and plenty of volatility. Shares fell more than 17 percent on Wednesday, after it spent far more than expected last year to lure and retain customers. The experience of rivals like Alibaba, though, suggests better times ahead.
