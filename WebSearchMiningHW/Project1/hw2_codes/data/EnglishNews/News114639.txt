India gets stuck in anti-corruption crossfire
MUMBAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - India is at risk of getting stuck in anti-corruption crossfire. After chasing down errant tycoons, authorities this week arrested opposition veteran and former finance minister, P. Chidambaram. The dramatic move, months after Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s landslide win, will fuel fears of factionalism. With the economy cooling and plenty of trouble spots to tackle, it also raises concerns over the unwanted consequences of an aggressive cleanup.
