Breakingviews - Private equity can sprint ahead in Adidas castoffs
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Reebok Classics are not a good fit for Adidas. Buyout firms are interested in buying the underperforming brand, best known for 80s trainer styles, the Financial Times reported. For an acquirer to make a private equity-style return, however, the German sportswear group will need to accept a much lower price than the $3.8 billion it paid in 2005.
