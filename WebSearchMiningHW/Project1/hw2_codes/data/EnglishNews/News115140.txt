Breakingviews - Legal woes poison Bayer’s prospects
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Roundup’s noxious effect is leaching deeper into Bayer. Shares in the German chemicals group slumped again on Wednesday after a second U.S. court said its widely used weed killer causes cancer. Bayer has shed $34 billion of market capitalisation since the first adverse ruling last August, effectively exterminating any value in its CropScience unit, which includes Roundup. With thousands of claims in the wings, even that may be too generous.
