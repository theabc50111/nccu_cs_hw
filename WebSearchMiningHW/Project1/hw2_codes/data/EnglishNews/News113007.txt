ZURICH (Reuters Breakingviews) - Pop into a gas station just about anywhere in south Florida to fill up the tank or snag a hot dog marinating in its own juices, and you may well be giving Maximo Alvarez your business. Having fled Fidel Castroâ€™s Cuba under Operation Peter Pan, which airlifted unaccompanied minors to the United States in the early 1960s, Alvarez founded Sunshine Gasoline Distributors in 1987. He now has 536 Exxon, Shell, Chevron, Mobil and Marathon outlets.
