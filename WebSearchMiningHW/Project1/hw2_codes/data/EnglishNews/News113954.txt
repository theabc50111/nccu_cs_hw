Breakingviews - Cheap oil will fund quasi-handouts for Indians
MUMBAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - India can afford to give consumers a boost. An effective month-long ban on foreign tourist visas goes into force on Friday as the government seeks to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Travel restrictions make sense to prevent a big outbreak in a poor nation with a weak health system, but the move will hurt a sector that contributes around a tenth of GDP in a slowing economy already reeling from financial blowups. New Delhi can soften the blow by allowing consumers to pocket the benefit of low crude prices.
