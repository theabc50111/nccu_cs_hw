Breakingviews - Direct listings will move nearer IPOs – and Europe
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - A direct listing is “just an IPO without the O,” says Barry McCarthy, finance chief of music-streaming outfit Spotify Technology. McCarthy’s company, worth $26 billion in early December, used the non-standard method to go public in 2018, and $12 billion workplace-messaging service Slack Technologies followed in 2019. Investors can expect more. Direct listings could start borrowing features from initial public offerings, and the whole notion may jump across the Atlantic.
