Breakingviews - Huawei settles into eye of geopolitical storm
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Huawei has now firmly settled into the eye of a geopolitical storm. Canadian officials arrested Meng Wanzhou, the Chinese telecom equipment makerâ€™s chief financial officer, for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions. The case arises just as more countries put the squeeze on Huawei. Suppliers will be rattled, too. It may be a microcosm of a broader containment effort.
