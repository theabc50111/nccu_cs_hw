Breakingviews - Altria-PMI deal could waft back into view
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Merger talks between Altria and Philip Morris International are off, but a deal could still rise from the ashes. The idea of a $187 billion combination has sputtered amid turmoil at Juul Labs, of which Altria owns 35%. The market is already suggesting that the vaping upstart is worth less than what Altria paid in December 2018. If it continues to fall, the logic of a combination could bring Philip Morris back for another pull.
