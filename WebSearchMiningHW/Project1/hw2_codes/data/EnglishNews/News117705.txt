Pentagon fails audit yet again, could pass around 2027, comptroller says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon failed its comprehensive audit in fiscal 2020, the third year it has failed since the first audit was conducted in 2018, reflecting system and accounting problems across its vast bureaucracy that could persist until 2027, the departmentâ€™s comptroller said on Monday.
