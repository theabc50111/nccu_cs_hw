Breakingviews - Greek banking reform takes hazy turn
MILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - Greece’s reform of its hard-hit financial sector is taking a hazy turn. On the eve of a big recapitalisation of Piraeus Bank, the head of its largest shareholder, the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, abruptly quit. While running the fund, which has stakes in Greece’s four large banks, Austrian Martin Czurda championed better corporate governance. His departure takes a shine off expected improvements to Greek banking, including a bad debt cleanup plan and new insolvency code.
