Breakingviews - British Airways hacking fine is painful precedent
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Europe’s data police have new fangs that are turning out to be pretty sharp. British Airways was told on Monday it faced a 183 million pound penalty for the theft of customer information from its website last year. That would be a record hacking fine and dwarfs the 500,000 pound maximum paid by Facebook under old European Union rules. The airline got some credit for notifying the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which polices the rules nationally. But the size of the punishment sets a painful precedent.
