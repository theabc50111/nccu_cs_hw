Breakingviews - China’s WM Motor will overtake Tesla wannabes
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s WM Motor will start pulling ahead of Tesla wannabes. The Shanghai-based upstart chose a different path to Elon Musk and compatriots such as Nio and Xpeng, opting to list at home instead of New York, and choosing the mass market over luxury. As a result, WM Motor will be close to gross profitability by the time it lists early in 2021.
