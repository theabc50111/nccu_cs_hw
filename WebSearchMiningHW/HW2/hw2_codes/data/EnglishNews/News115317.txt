Breakingviews - Xinjiang is an extreme case of China's growth woes
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Xinjiang is becoming an extreme example of the economic woes ailing China’s poorest provinces. Beijing says it is de-radicalising the Uighur population in the far-western region with vocational training camps. Mass detentions, however, are not helping businesses or jobs, and investment has tanked. It’s the bleeding edge of a damaging capital retreat from the country’s hinterland which has already pushed at least 23 regions to slash 2019 targets: hardly a recipe for revival.
