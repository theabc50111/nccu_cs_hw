Breakingviews - Murdoch lets Bertelsmann pay up for publishing
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rupert Murdoch is writing his own ending in the book publishing M&A brouhaha. Rival Bertelsmann will pay $2.2 billion for the U.S. market’s third-biggest book purveyor Simon & Schuster, the companies said on Wednesday. The German media group already owns the massive Penguin Random House and the deal would make it the biggest by far. But U.S. regulators could thwart the transaction too, leaving News Corp’s architect an opening.
