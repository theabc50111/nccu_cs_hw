Breakingviews - GM strike deal brings less relief than expected
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - New Buicks, Cadillacs and Chevys may soon start rolling out of factories across America again. On Wednesday, negotiators for the United Auto Workers and General Motors finally struck a deal aimed at ending their month-long dispute over the next four-year workers contract. Details may not emerge until Thursday, and the 48,000 or so union members who work at the $52 billion automaker have to vote on it. Either way, the resolution brings less relief than expected.
