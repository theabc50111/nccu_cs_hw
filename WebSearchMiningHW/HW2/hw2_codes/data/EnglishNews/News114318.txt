Breakingviews - ThaiBev is tempting Budweiser with a Saigon brew
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - A Thai billionaire is tempting Budweiser to the bar. Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi-controlled Thai Beverage, maker of Chang lager, may list its beer assets in Singapore, including a much-coveted Vietnamese brew. A mooted $10 billion valuation suggests such a move could unlock some value, but the real prize here is a deal with Anheuser-Busch InBevâ€™s recently listed Asian arm.
