Breakingviews - Dylan sale suits him, but not changin' times
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - A hard rain may be falling on many musicians during the pandemic, but not on Bob Dylan. Universal Music said on Monday that its publishing division bought the 79-year-old songwriting legendâ€™s entire 600-plus catalog. The deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Selling now makes sense for the aging Nobel laureate, but his deal with an established industry player is unique. Greener artists getting offers for their work should think twice.
