Breakingviews - Bristol Myers deal gamble pays off twice over
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bristol Myers Squibb has landed two birds in the bush. When the $134 billion U.S. drug firm agreed to buy rival oncology specialist Celgene for $74 billion in 2019, it had to divest an autoimmune drug to satisfy regulators. Instead of keeping Celgeneâ€™s proven blockbuster Otezla, it sold the drug to Amgen for $13.4 billion, keeping an unproven candidate instead. Now a rare head-to-head trial comparing the two drugs suggests boss Giovanni Caforio got the better end of one, and possibly two big deals.
