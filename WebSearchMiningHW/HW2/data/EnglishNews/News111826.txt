Breakingviews - Carlos Slim’s KPN cash call includes buyout cover
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Carlos Slim is putting the wreckage of his failed 2013 takeover of KPN to good use.

If KPN stock treads water, Slim effectively borrows for less than nothing. If it recovers, he still has some insurance.
