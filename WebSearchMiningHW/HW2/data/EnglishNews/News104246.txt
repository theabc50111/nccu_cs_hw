Biden's election will not undo Trump interference in Huawei extradition case, lawyers say
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Lawyers for Huawei’s chief financial officer said on Wednesday that Joe Biden’s election as U.S. president will not undo the political interference in her case, which they say stems from former President Donald Trump’s pledge to intervene if it helped the United States extract a more favorable trade deal from China.
