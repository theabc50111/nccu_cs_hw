Breakingviews - EU green deal is a 1 trln euro diversion
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis calls it “a colossal exercise in greenwashing”. German Member of the European Parliament Niklas Nienass has likened its “sleight of hand” to a magic trick. The European Green Deal is arguably both of these things. But with the bloc’s emissions reductions targets due on Wednesday to be enshrined in law, the exercise is probably best understood as a placeholder until Europe is ready for more robust action.
