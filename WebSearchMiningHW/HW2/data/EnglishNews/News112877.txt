Breakingviews - Hadas: Markets’ risky fling is far from over
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The financial world’s post-pandemic exuberance just might have passed its peak. After fuelling an astonishing rebound in stock and bond prices in the past six months, global investors are showing signs of caution. The NYSE FANG+ Index of 10 leading high-tech stocks is down 12% since Sept. 2, although it is still double its March low. The wider U.S. S&P 500 Index has fallen by 10%. Those declines could be a leading indicator of a calmer investment environment.
