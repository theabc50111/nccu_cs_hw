U.S. focused on 'future conduct' of Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi sanctions, spokesman says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is focused on “future conduct” of Saudi Arabia and will expect Riyadh to improve its human rights record, a U.S. spokesman said on Monday, after Washington imposed sanctions on some Saudis for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi but fell short of sanctions against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
