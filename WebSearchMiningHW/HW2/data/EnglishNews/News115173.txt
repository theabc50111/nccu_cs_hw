Breakingviews - Ping An stock repurchase comes with Beijing twist
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ping An’s share repurchase comes with a Beijing twist. China’s biggest insurer by market value plans to buy up to $1.5 billion of its Shanghai shares. The company, which has a Hong Kong listing too, says it’s undervalued. But this transaction also responds to an official push to bolster mainland markets. Shareholders benefitted this time, but such policy winds can blow both ways.
