Breakingviews - Airbnb IPO surge puts pressure on next unicorns
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - The unicorns next door have a lot to live up to after Airbnbâ€™s initial public offering. Shares of the home-sharing app more than doubled on Thursday, beating the 80% rise of food-delivery firm DoorDash in its own debut a day earlier. Airbnb has some rare traits compared to other frothy offerings, but investors and other billion-dollar-plus issuers are likely to see its runaway performance as a new norm.
