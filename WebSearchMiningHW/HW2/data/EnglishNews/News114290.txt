Breakingviews - Chevron $10 bln pain will soon look like peanuts
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - America’s big fossil-fuel companies are taking too simplistic approach to climate risk. Chevron on Tuesday followed ConocoPhillips’ lead from last month in emphasizing shorter-term, less capital-intensive and, it hopes, higher-return assets. That may reduce the financial pain that will come from longer-term projects becoming uneconomic – or stranded, in finance-speak - as global warming hits. Even so, what lies ahead will make Chevron’s $10 billion writedown of gas assets on Tuesday look like peanuts.
