LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mario Draghi is channelling a new cartoon character. The outgoing European Central Bank boss, dubbed Super Mario for all he did to fight the euro zone crisis and revive growth, on Thursday unveiled fresh stimulus measures, including a rate cut and new asset purchases. The open-ended nature of the buying smacks of Toy Story’s Buzz Lightyear. Markets seem to think it will last to infinity and beyond.
