Breakingviews - BHP selfishly brushes up green credentials

Surging iron ore sales cushioned declines in other commodities, as underlying earnings attributable to continuing operations fell 4% to $9.1 billion for the fiscal year. Boss Mike Henry plans to ditch some high-polluting energy assets, though for economic, not for environmental, motives. It still makes strategic sense.
