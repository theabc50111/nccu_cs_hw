Breakingviews - SoftBank’s new $108 bln vision is broader, fuzzier
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - SoftBank’s new megafund, officially unveiled on Friday, is a fuzzier affair than its predecessor. Vision Fund 2 aspires to bring $108 billion of capital to disruptive and potentially market-reshaping technologies like artificial intelligence. If the first Vision Fund is a guide, it could alter competitive landscapes across a variety of sectors and create huge wealth for backers. It will also test SoftBank leader Masayoshi Son’s ability to stay focused.
