Breakingviews - Four lessons of Theresa May’s third Brexit defeat
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Only one definite conclusion can be drawn from Theresa May’s latest parliamentary defeat. Britain will not leave the European Union on March 29, despite the prime minister’s repeated promises that it would. After lawmakers on Friday voted by a majority of 58 to reject her Brexit deal for the third time, the country will remain part of the bloc for at least another two weeks.
