Breakingviews - Hong Kong property tycoon builds model buyout
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - A Hong Kong tycoon’s take-private offer could become a model for the city’s stingy real estate industry. Former chairman and majority shareholder Peter Woo wants to take developer Wheelock and Company private using cash and shares in subsidiaries. He’s shrewd to pull the plug on the discounted, thinly traded holding company while an epidemic threatens commercial property sales. The 52% implied premium is fair, and should be a pleasant surprise to local investors.
