Xerox drawn into duplicative Japanese fight
MELBOURNE (Reuters Breakingviews) - A company synonymous with copying should expect some duplication. Xerox has become aggressive since pushy investor Carl Icahn arrived on the scene. After rancorously blowing up a deal and ending a 57-year joint venture with Japan’s Fujifilm, the U.S. printer maker initiated a hostile $35 billion bid for rival HP. Now a longtime partner of HP’s is threatening to break ties if the takeover is successful.
