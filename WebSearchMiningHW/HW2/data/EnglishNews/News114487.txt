Breakingviews - Review: Making American taxes great again
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Two Frenchmen want to make American taxes great again. Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman are students of Thomas Piketty, whose tome on inequality sold two million copies. Now the pair, both economics professors at the University of California, Berkeley have produced their own much shorter book: “The Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay”. It’s a combination of Piketty-style number crunching with some helpful cultural analysis, plus a bit of political advocacy.
