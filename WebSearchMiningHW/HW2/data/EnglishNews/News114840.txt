Breakingviews - Carrefour beats a dignified retreat from China
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Carrefour is beating a dignified retreat from China. The French retailer is selling an 80% stake in its local operations to Suning.com after more than two decades in the market. Valued at 1.4 billion euros including debt, the price looks decent given Carrefourâ€™s slowing sales. For Suning and partner Alibaba, it opens a new front against e-commerce rivals.
