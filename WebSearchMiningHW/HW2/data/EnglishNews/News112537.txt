Breakingviews - SEC chair departure starts warped musical chairs
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - U.S. financial watchdogs are starting to play a warped version of musical chairs. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton kicked off the game on Monday by announcing he will depart at the end of the year, six months prior to his term’s end. It means his spot will be filled by a lame duck acting chair. That’s on top of President-elect Joe Biden’s late start on the transition as Chinese listings, blank-check companies, and other issues await SEC scrutiny. As financial regulators vacate, corporate malfeasance continues while rules reining them in go unfinished.
