BODELWYDDAN, Wales (Reuters) - (This version of the March 21 story was corrected to show the first use of gold from Wales in 1923 was for a wedding ring, not other jewelry; that Clogau Gold of Wales only owns Gwynfynydd mine; that Clogau Gold of Wales did not supply the royals with gold; that the Clogau St David and Gwynfynydd mines are not both in Bontddu; other details)
