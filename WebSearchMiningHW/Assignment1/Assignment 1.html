[15 points] <strong>Evaluation Measures</strong>

<p>
Suppose a query has a total of 10 relevant documents in a collection with 100 documents.
A system has retrieved 8 documents whose relevance status is $$  [+,-,+,-,-,+,-,+] $$ in the order of ranking.
A "+" (or "-") indicates that the corresponding document is relevant (or non-relevant).
For example, the first document is relevant, while the second is non-relevant, etc.

</p><ul>
<li> [10/15 points] Compute the precision, recall, fallout, F1, and average precision for this result. </li>
<li> [5/15 points] What is the precision at the recall level of 0.15 according to 11-point interpolated? </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>

<li>
[20 points] <strong>Evaluation Measures</strong>

<p>
Consider the  following two systems A and B with their corresponding search results, 
in which there are 5 relevance grades (0,1: non-relevant, 2, 3,4,5: relevant).
Their top 10 results are judged for relevance as follows (the leftmost item is the top ranked search result):

</p><dl>
<dd>SystemA:  0 3 2 0 5  0 0 0 0 4 </dd>
<dd>SystemB:  4 0 0 0 5  0 2 0 0 3 </dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li> [5/20 points] What is the MAP of each system? </li>
<li> [5/20 points] What is the R-precision of each system? Does it rank the systems the same as MAP? </li>
<li> [5/20 points] What is the NDCG of each system? </li>
<li> [5/20 points] What is the main difference between MAP and NDCG? </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>

<li>
[20 points] <strong>Evaluation Measures</strong>

<p>
The following list of Rs and Ns represents relevant (R) and nonrelevant (N) returned documents in a ranked list of 20 documents
retrieved in response to a query from a collection of 10,000 documents.
The top of the ranked list  (the document the system thinks is most likely to be relevant) is on the left of the list.
This list shows 6 relevant documents. Assume that there are 8 relevant documents in total in the collection.

</p><dl>
<dd>N N R N N  R R N N R  N N N R N  N N N R N</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>[5/20 points] What is the precision of the system on the top 10? </li>
<li>[5/20 points] What is the F1 on the top 10?</li>
<li>[5/20 points] What is the uninterpolated precision of the system at 25% recall?</li>
<li>[5/20 points] What is the interpolated precision at 33% recall?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>

<li>
[10 points] <strong>Vector Space Model</strong>
<p>
Consider a collection with the documents:

</p><dl>
<dd>Document1: recall is very very high</dd>
<dd>Document2: high precision is very very very important</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>[5/10] What would be the tf-idf vector of each document?</li>
<li>[5/10] What would be the similarity score for the documents using cosine similarity?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>

<li>
[10 points] <strong>Vector Space Model</strong>

<p>
Consider a collection with the documents and the given query:<br>

</p><dl>
<dd><strong>Document1</strong>: federer has got twenty grand slam champion</dd>
<dd><strong>Document2</strong>: nadal is the king of roland garros because he won thirteen times champion</dd>
<dd><strong>Query</strong>: king won champion</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>[5/10] Assume there are no stop words. What would be the tf vector of each document?</li>
<li>[5/10] Assume the stop words are: the, of, to, is, and, because, in, has, not. What would be the similarity score of the query with each document using Jaccard coefficient?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>

<li>
[25 points] <strong>Vector Space Model</strong>.
<p>
Consider the following table of term frequencies and document frequencies for 3 documents, which are denoted as Doc1, Doc2, Doc3, and suppose that there are 70,000 documents in total within the document collection.</p>
<center><img src="./Assignment 1_files/vsm.png" height="120"></center>
<br>
<ul>
<li>[5/25] Compute the tf-idf weights for the terms "car", "auto", "insurance", "best", for each document.</li>
<li>[5/25] Can the tf-idf weight of a term in a document exceed 1? Why or why not?</li>
<li>[5/25] Compute the Euclidean normalized document vector for representing each documents, in each of which vector there are the four terms. </li>
<li>[10/25] Rank the three documents with respect to the query "best car insurance" according to the following settings of query term weighting:
<ul>
<li>The weight of a term is 1 if present in the query, 0 otherwise. </li>
<li>query tf * normalized idf of the collection.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Submission Details</h3>
<ul>
<li> Due: 18:10, Tuesday, 15 March 2022, in Class
</li><li> What to turn in: <br><br>
Please turn in a hardcopy of your written answers in "English." 

<p></p>
</li><li> Late policy:
<p> Note: In general, late homework receives fewer points than incomplete
homework, because the penalty for late homework is about 20 points per day.</p>
